a style guide was also included in the starter files which included font-family and the hsl information of the webpage. Apart from this, there was no more information given in order to make this design a reality. 
For this challenge, I had to make the website responsive, and made a decision to make the tablet viewport look the same as mobile viewport. 
This site was built with HTLM, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. 

The form does not sumbit completely, as there is no destination for the submit.
